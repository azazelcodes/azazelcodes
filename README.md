❔ - I do a bit of everything really. I dabbled my feet in the waters of Forge modding, played around with the Discord API and have done some other stuff here and there. </br>
📖 - My primary language is Python, but I also know some Java, HTML and CSS. </br>
🌍 - I'm from Munich, Germany so all of you Americans are sleeping at my prime time <3 </br>
