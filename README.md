❔ - I do a bit of everything really. I've dabbled my feet in the waters of Forge modding, played around with the Discord API and have done some other stuff here and there. </br>
📖 - The language I enjoy the most is Haxe, but I also know Python, some Java and Rust. </br>
🌍 - I'm from Munich, Germany so midnight is @ <t:253402210800:t> for me </br>
